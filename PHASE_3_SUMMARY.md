## **🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### **Advanced Cache System**
```javascript
// Cache decorator usage
@cacheable({ ttl: 3600, tags: ['products'] })
async getProducts(filters) {
  // Method implementation
}

// Cache middleware usage
app.use('/api/products', cacheMiddleware({ 
  ttl: 300, 
  condition: (req) => req.method === 'GET' 
}));
```

### **Message Queue Integration**
```javascript
// Add job to queue
await messageQueue.addJob('email', {
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Order Confirmation',
  body: 'Your order has been confirmed'
}, { priority: JOB_PRIORITY.HIGH });

// Custom job processor
messageQueue.processQueue('custom', async (data, job) => {
  // Custom processing logic
});
```

### **Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Production
docker-compose up -d

# Kubernetes deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
# Automated testing and deployment
- name: Run tests
  run: npm run test:all

- name: Build and push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5

- name: Deploy to staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: ./scripts/deploy.sh -e staging
```
