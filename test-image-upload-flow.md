## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "No file uploaded" Error
**Symptoms**: Backend returns 400 with "No file uploaded"
**Causes**:
- FormData not properly constructed
- Wrong field name in FormData
- Multer configuration issue

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check `[uploadImage] FormData contents` logs
2. Verify field name is "image"
3. Check `[upload] Request headers` for Content-Type

### Issue 2: "Upload failed" Error
**Symptoms**: Frontend receives error response
**Causes**:
- File size too large
- Invalid file type
- Server storage issues

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check file size in `[ProductImageUpload] File selected` logs
2. Verify file type is jpeg/png
3. Check server uploads directory permissions

### Issue 3: Image Not Displaying
**Symptoms**: Product saved but image doesn't show
**Causes**:
- Wrong image path in database
- Static file serving not configured
- CORS issues with images

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check `[ProductTable] getImageUrl` logs
2. Verify image path in database
3. Test direct image URL in browser
4. Check network tab for image requests

### Issue 4: "Missing/invalid image" Validation Error
**Symptoms**: Product save fails with validation error
**Causes**:
- imageUrl not properly set after upload
- Response field mismatch

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check `[useProductManagement] uploadImage response` logs
2. Verify response contains `filePath` field
3. Check `[useProductManagement] Final cleanedData` logs

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Image Upload**: File successfully uploaded to server
‚úÖ **Database Storage**: Image path correctly stored in product document
‚úÖ **Image Display**: Image loads correctly in product table
‚úÖ **Edit Functionality**: Can edit product and upload new image
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed uploads

## üîß Quick Fixes

### If upload endpoint not found:
```javascript
// In client/src/api/upload.js - Remove ?type=image
const response = await api.post('/upload', formData, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
});
```

### If response field mismatch:
```javascript
// In client/src/hooks/useProductManagement.jsx
const response = await uploadImage(uploadData);
imageUrl = response.filePath; // Make sure this matches backend response
```

### If static files not serving:
```javascript
// In server/app.js - Ensure this is present
app.use('/uploads/images', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads/images')));
```
